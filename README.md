MentorPi Robot System Exploration and Documentation

## Project Overview

This repository documents the **exploration, evaluation, understanding, and operational development** of the MentorPi robotic platform. The work focuses on gaining a complete technical understanding of the robot’s hardware and software ecosystem, including ROS 2 integration, sensors, networking infrastructure, and system control capabilities.

The goal is to create a **clear, reproducible reference** for future research, experimentation, and development involving the robotic system.

## Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:

- Develop a complete understanding of the robot system architecture.
- Document hardware components including LiDAR, cameras, battery system, motors, and onboard sensors.
- Analyze communication between server, client, Docker containers, ROS 2 environment, and Raspberry Pi.
- Identify system limitations or hardware/software issues (example: front axle/wheel malfunction).
- Enable reliable experimentation and future autonomous robotics research.

This repository serves as both a **technical record of exploration** and a **foundation for future research work**.
